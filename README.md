Getting and cleaning data project
=================================

This is my submission for the project of the Coursera course Getting and
Cleaning Data by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD.

The course website is found on [Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-030).

File descriptions
-----------------

In this repository, you will find two R scrips:

 * get_data.R: Downloads the project data and unzips them. After running this,
   you'll find the zip file "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip" in the
   current folder and its unzipped content under the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
 * analyse_data.R: This script analyses the data as laid out by the get_data.R
   script and create a new file "summary.txt" which contains the analysis
   results.
   
Analysis description
--------------------

Here is what the analyse_data.R script does.
